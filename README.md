# EXPERIMENT-8
## AIM
To study and implement C++ 2D array matrices

## THEORY
Matrices in C++ are represented as 2D arrays. They are used to store and manipulate data in a structured, tabular form.

### 1.Introduction to Matrices :
A matrix is a collection of elements arranged in rows and columns.<br>
In C++, matrices are typically implemented using 2D arrays.

### 2.Declaration :
Matrix Declaration Using 2D Arrays (Static Allocation).<br>This is useful when the size of the matrix is known at compile time.
```
// Declaration of a 3x3 matrix
int matrix[3][3];
```

### 3Initialization of Matrix :
Matrix can be initialized using a 2D array either by assigning values explicitly during declaration or by using loops to assign values later.
```
    // Initializing a 3x3 matrix
    int matrix[3][3] = {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    };
```
### 4.Accessing Elements of a Matrix :
In C++, you can access elements of a matrix (2D array) using row and column indices.
```
int value = matrix[1][2];
```

### 5.Addition of Matrix :
To perform matrix addition using 2D arrays in C++:

1. *Matrix Dimensions*: Both matrices must have the same dimensions (same number of rows and columns).
2. *Create Two Matrices*: Define two 2D arrays representing the matrices to be added.
3. *Result Matrix*: Create a third 2D array to store the result of the addition.
4. *Addition Process*: Use nested loops to iterate over each element of both matrices, adding corresponding elements together.
5. *Store Result*: Store the sum of corresponding elements from the two matrices in the result matrix.

The result matrix will contain the sum of the two input matrices, element by element.

### 6.Subtraction of Matrix :
Matrix subtraction in C++ using 2D arrays follows a similar process to matrix addition.<br>
To subtract two matrices, you subtract corresponding elements of each matrix.<br> Both matrices must have the same dimensions.

1. *Same Dimensions*: Ensure both matrices have the same number of rows and columns.
2. *Two Matrices*: Define two 2D arrays to represent the matrices.
3. *Result Matrix*: Create a 2D array to store the result of the subtraction.
4. *Subtraction Process*: Use nested loops to iterate through both matrices, subtract corresponding elements.
5. *Store the Difference*: Store the difference in the result matrix.

The resulting matrix will store the difference of the two input matrices, element by element.

### 7.Multiplication of Matrix :
1. *Check Dimensions*: Ensure the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.

2. *Initialize Result Matrix*: Create a matrix with dimensions of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix.

3. *Perform Multiplication*:
   - Iterate through rows of the first matrix.
   - Iterate through columns of the second matrix.
   - Compute the dot product of the current row and column.
   - Store the result in the corresponding position in the result matrix.

### 8.Transpose of Matrix :
1. *Create a New Matrix*: Initialize a matrix with dimensions swapped (rows become columns and vice versa).

2. *Assign Values*:
   - Iterate through the original matrixâ€™s columns.
   - For each column, iterate through its rows.
   - Assign values to the new matrix based on the current column and row indices.

## Conclusion -
This experiment provides valuable insight into fundamental concepts in programming, particularly in handling data structures that require multi-dimensional organization. Through this process, we gain a deeper understanding of how to: <br>

* Efficiently Store and Manipulate Data: Using 2D arrays, we can efficiently store data in a tabular format, making it easier to perform operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices.

* Develop Problem-Solving Skills: Implementing matrix operations enhances logical thinking and problem-solving skills, as it requires careful consideration of indices, loops, and data handling.

* Understand Memory Management: Working with 2D arrays in C++ also provides an understanding of how memory is allocated and accessed in programming, especially in managing rows and columns of data.
